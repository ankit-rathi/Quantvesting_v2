## Module 3: Introduction to Investing

### Introduction

Hey everyone! We’ve talked about **earning** money and the **power of saving**. But today, we’re going to take things a step further—**investing**. 

Why are we talking about this? Because just saving money is **not enough**. If you keep all your money in a bank, over time, it actually loses value. Sounds strange? Let’s see why.

### Why Keeping Money in a Bank is Not Enough

Imagine you have Rs. 100 today. You can buy a burger with it. But what if, a few years later, the same burger costs Rs. 150? Your Rs. 100 is still in the bank, but now it can’t buy the same thing. This is called **inflation**—prices of things go up over time, and if your money isn’t growing, you’re actually losing purchasing power.

Saving money in a bank is good for safety and short-term needs, but to **grow** your money, you need something more—**investing**.

### What is Investing?

Investing means **making your money work for you**. Instead of just sitting in a bank, your money is put into things that grow in value over time.

Think of it like planting a tree. If you plant a seed today and take care of it, in a few years, it becomes a big tree giving fruits and shade. In the same way, investments grow over time, and you can earn more money from them.

### Types of Investments

There are many ways to invest, but here are some of the most common ones:

1. **Stocks** – Buying a small part of a company. If the company does well, your money grows.
2. **Bonds** – Lending money to the government or companies. They pay you back with interest.
3. **Gold** – People invest in gold because it holds value over time.
4. **Real Estate** – Buying land or property that increases in value over time.

Each investment has different levels of growth and risk, which brings us to our next topic.

### Understanding Risk & Reward

All investments come with some level of risk. Let’s break it down:

- **Low Risk (Safe, but slow growth)** – Bank savings, Fixed Deposits, Government Bonds. Your money is safe, but it grows slowly.
- **Medium Risk (Balanced growth)** – Gold, Real Estate. Prices go up over time, but not always consistently.
- **High Risk (Can grow fast, but can also lose money fast)** – Stocks. If chosen wisely, stocks can make you rich, but bad choices can also lead to losses.

A smart investor balances risk and reward. You don’t put **all your money** in one place, and you always think long-term.
